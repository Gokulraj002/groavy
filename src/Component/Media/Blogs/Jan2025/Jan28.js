              <span>
                <strong>Verify Legal Documentation:</strong> Ensure the farmland
                has clear titles, is free from disputes, and complies with all
                legal requirements. Consulting a legal expert is highly
                recommended for a stress-free transaction.

                <strong>Check Soil Quality and Water Availability:</strong>{" "}
                Conduct soil tests to assess fertility and confirm the
                availability of reliable water sources. These factors are
                essential for successful farming and long-term productivity.

                <strong>Understand Zoning Laws:</strong> Make sure the land is
                designated for agricultural use to avoid future legal
                complications. Understanding local zoning regulations ensures
                your farmland can be used as intended.

                for fencing, irrigation, soil care, and pest control. Proper
                maintenance ensures your farmland remains productive and retains
                its value over time.
